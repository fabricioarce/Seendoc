# Seendoc

**Seendoc** is a fully open-source and independent web search engine focused on privacy, security, and ethical use.

Unlike traditional search engines, Seendoc does not track users, log queries, or sell data. It is designed to empower users with control over their information while providing fast and relevant results.

The project aims to go beyond basic search by integrating AI-powered summaries, ethical content curation, and community-driven result valuation.
